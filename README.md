Objective 

Building the server-side component of a “movies” web application. 
The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. 
Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

Context
It’s no longer enough for a JavaScript developer to be skilled in frontend development alone. 
It’s become essential that developer will be able to interface with (as you did in Achievement 1) and even create their own APIs. 
The  REST API will be built for an application called “myFlix” that 
interactswith a database that stores data about different movies.

## Requirements 

● The API must be a Node.js and Express application.
● The API must use REST architecture, with URL endpoints corresponding to the data
operations listed above
